The Word Happiness Report Statistical Analysis project is a simple linear regression analysis of data from the World Happiness Report. The analysis aims to identify the relationship between happiness score and various factors such as GDP, social support, and life expectancy.

#### Introduction

Happiness is a complex and subjective concept that has garnered significant interest in psychology and social science. The World Happiness Report provides a valuable dataset to examine the factors impacting happiness levels globally. This report aims to analyze trends in happiness scores across countries, compare mean scores between developed and developing regions, and investigate the impact of economic factors on happiness scores.
